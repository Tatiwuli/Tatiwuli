# Hi! I am Tatiane 👋

Software Engineer who builds to solve real problems, not just tech for tech's sake. I work closely with users to design and ship end-to-end applications that actually make their lives easier.

🎓 Currently at Minerva University  (Class of 2027), rotating through 6 countries each semester while working on tech projects with local business 🌍.

My main background in Software Engineering includes: API development, ETL pipelines, full-stack development with TypeScript & Python, and product thinking.

### 👩🏻‍💻 Why Software Engineering? 
I find it fascinating to build software that makes people's lives easier so they can achieve better versions of themselves. There's something deeply satisfying about solving complex technical challenges in the background—making the impossible possible—while keeping the user experience simple and elegant. The puzzle of balancing technical depth with intuitive design is challenging but FUN!
